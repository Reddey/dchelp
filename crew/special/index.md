Chester McCoy is a unique crewman (So far) as he can fulfill 2 jobs, either sourcing vehicles or weapons. Beware though as picking him twice will charge you the both times instead of only once. (20% If he is picked for both the Gunman role and Driver role)

Yohan Blair, he is your Nightclub technician. This automaticly means he has the brains needed to keep the vault open and cameras tricked while you and your teammate sweep the goods. Even though he is skilled in obtaining nightclub cargo, it doesn't mean he will be perfect at delaying the vault response. To unlock him you must buy a nightclub and complete all setup missions.
