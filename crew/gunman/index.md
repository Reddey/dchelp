## Gunmen

### Weapons & Kit

Your gunmen provide your weapons that you will be using in the heist itself. This can either mean extremely little or a lot, Generally in the Big Con and Silent & Sneaky approaches weapons are completely useless, as the best Big Con setup lets you kill only 3 enemies and all silenced guns 1-shot kill anyone in the Silent & Sneaky approach (That is, if you did the supply convoy setup, if you didn't, consider bringing a better gunman)
