# Main loot.

## There are 4 main types of loot.

### Loot 1: Cash

(Placeholder text)

Cash is by far the most common loot, also being the one you always get for doing the Casino Heist initially as an introductory loot. Recommended to get 4 players to clean out vault

### Loot 2: Artwork

(Placeholder text)

Artwork is considered by many the best loot for when you play the heist with only 2 players, as 2 players can easily clean out the vault on Normal, while on hard you only miss out on 1 or 2 paintings. Recommended to get 2 players to clean out vault.

### Loot 3: Gold

(Placeholder text)

Gold is the rarest non-special loot you can get, being part of the initial 3 that released with the Casino Heist update itself on 12 December, it was up untill 2/13/2020 the most expensive loot you could steal. Recommended to get 4 players to clean out vault.

### Loot 4: Diamonds

(Placeholder text)

The rarest of all available loots. Currently unknown if Diamonds will be available post Valentines Day tunable update. As of right now though, setting up the Diamond Casino Heist anytime between 2/13/2020-2/20/2020 will guarantee Diamonds for the first time, with either a 8% chance to get Diamonds again OR a decreasing spawn rate for them. Recommended to get 4 players to clean out vault, but if you and your teammate are skilled enough, you can do it Duo.

# Minor Loot.

## Not as grand as the Main loot, but still can increase payout by a sizeable chunk.

### Minor Loot 1: Daily Vault

(Placeholder link 4 floor page.)

Located on the Casino floor (As opposed to Vault level, where all other loot types are found.) this can be either be looted before or after looting the main vault. It can have anywhere between 20000$ to 150000$. The Daily Vault requires 2 players to loot it, 1 player needs to be in the Security Office to hold down the button while the other player goes to vault itself and enters. The Daily Vault will always contain 1 cash cart that has money ranging in the 2 provided sums. It acts like the cash carts from vault itself, only with significantly less money.

### Minor Loot 2: Safety Deposit Boxes

(Placeholder link 4 detailed view.)

(Placeholder link 4 floor page.)

Located inside the cages in the Main Vault, these can be opened if you did / bought the Power Drills setup. They either contain nothing or small pouches containing 10000$. Usually a wall / bank of Safety Deposit Boxes (Anywhere from 3 to 7) will net an additional 30000$ to 70000$. It takes roughly 4 seconds to drill open a Safety Deposit Box, so if you are caught in the time period where you dont have enough time to clean out a money cart, but still have enough time to do smaller things in the vault, consider drilling the boxes open, as within 40 seconds, personally me and a friend were able to get 200000$ more due to boxes.
