To clean out a vault full of artwork it's recommended to have 2 players. 3 Players increase the ammount of locked doors wich decreases the ammount of overall paintings you can steal.
With 2 players anywhere from 2 to 6 doors will be locked wich can easily be hacked by 1 player while the other cuts the paintings down. 
With 4 players the max ammount of doors will be hacked, but if 2 players hack and 2 bag the paintings there wont be a problem. But you will earn less money overall
as you have to give 15% to your friends / players thus resulting in less cash earned overall
