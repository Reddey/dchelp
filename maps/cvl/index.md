Points of interest:

## 1) Entrance Stairwell / Elevator

Connects the following floors togheter: Casino Floor, Security Passage Floor and Vault Floor. You ALWAYS have to use this Stairwell / Elevator. Its recommended to use the Stairwell as opposed to the Elevator, as the Stairwell provides cover whereas the Elevator throws you infront of enemies in certain ocassions

## 2) Security Checkpoint

The 1st guard room before the Mantrap, it usually contains 2 enemies at the desks on either end, 2 enemies overlooking the desks from the doors of the empty rooms, 2 patrolling guards and 2 180* rotating cameras. Depending on approach, this is either a minor inconvenience or a situation that requires careful planning.

## 3) Office Elevator

This is a direct elevator from Ms. Bakers office straight to the Vault. Used (As far as i know as of 1/28/2020) only in Big Con w/ Yung Ancestor or Bugstars entry disguises.

## 4) Mantrap Entrance

The 2nd guard room before the Mantrap. The room above the Mantrap Entrance is a reinforced security office with a guard inside and either a level 1 or level 2 keycard scanner at one of the 2 possible doors. Depending on approach, this is either a minor inconvenience or a small problem that can be easily solved.

## 5) Mantrap

Just the 2 sided Glory Walk between the Vault and You. There is nothing here apart from a transition that changes the interior location from underneath Mt. Chilliad to underneath the NOOSE server farm. Just at the end of the Mantrap and the Entrance of the vault there is a single guard that is taken out in a cutscene or incase there is no cutscene, he is not there at all.

## 6) Vault

Go crazy. The supreme objective of the entire heist. Can contain 1 of 4 different valuables. Artwork, Cash, Gold and Diamonds (Diamonds are currently unavailable for unknown reasons). In the same order as above, they cost more towards the right and less towards the left. Cash Gold and Diamonds have similar grab times between 40 seconds to 1 minute and 10 seconds, while Artwork only takes 19 seconds per painting to steal. Most of the Loot is hidden away behind security grates that are locked (With 2 players, between 3 and 4 doors will be locked, requiring hacking. With 3 players most doors will be locked. With 4 players all doors are locked.). To open the security grates you have to hack them open using the fingerprint minigame. On easy you only need to do this once, on hard it needs to be done twice to open a door.
