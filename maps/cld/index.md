Points of interest:

## 1) Staff Entrance

The Staff Entrance is one of the possible Entry / Exit points obtainable via looking through all the cameras in the Vault Scope-out mission. It is considered by many to be one of the best Exit points due to its proximity to the Horse Racing Track which has 0 (In full stealth / Big Con) or 3 (In Agressive approach OR if you get detected in Stealth / Big Con) enemies.

## 2) Security Office

The Security Office is a reinforced room, frequented by the guards. It has bulletproof windows (Except on the doors) and either a level 2 or level 1 keypad. The Security Offices main use during the heist is to open the Daily Vault, but it can also be used as a hold-your-ground point, where enemies can only attack you if they enter the Security Office itself.

## 3) Daily Vault

The Daily Vault serves as a little bit of side cash from the main vault itself, As Lester said, its not the main objective so dont get too clouded in it. You can access the Daily Vault anytime, Either before robbing the main vault (Easier in the case of Agressive and Stealth approaches) or after robbing the main vault (Easier again, in the case of Agressive and Stealth). Robbing the Daily Vault while playing Big Con is difficult (Unless you get detected) as killing anyone while being seen will nullify your disguises. The Daily Vault contains anywhere between 50.000 GTA$ to 100.000 GTA$. To open the Daily Vault one player needs to be in the Security Office to hold down the door opening button and another needs to be near the vault to enter and empty it. Dont worry about getting locked inside as there is a button on the inside to open it. 

## 4) Office Stairwell / Elevator

The Office Stairwell / Elevator is only used (As far as i know as of 1/27/2020) in the Big Con approach (Bugstars or Yung Ancestor). It leads up to the Resort level of the casino, and a short walk away from Ms. Bakers office.

## 5) Waste Disposal

The 2nd best Entry / Exit method, obtainable by looking through the cameras in the Vault Scope-out mission. It leads towards the Horse Racing Seating Area once you exit. There will always be either 1 or 2 enemies to the side when leaving throug here, If detected or not (Doesn't affect Big Con if you are using NOOSE exit disguise)

## 6) Laundry

The Laundry is one of the most crucial spots you can go to during Big Con and Stealth approached, in Big Con, it should be your main objective after robbing the vault, as it contains your exit disguises, making the heist a cakewalk in the right method. During stealth the Laundry room can be used as a safehaven from patrolling guards and cameras, as no-one enters there. If you are detected during Stealth or Big Con, enemies may run inside and become invisible on the minimap, leading to a nasty surprise.

## 7) Vault Stairwell / Elevator

The Vault Stairwell / Elevator is the main objective to reach when entering the casino, in the case of Yung Ancestor and Bugstars entry disguises for Big Con, this is instead replaced to the Office Stairwell / Elevator. It isn't completely safe as in the Stealth approach there will be 2 cameras and 1 guard who will walk up the stairs once you go down 1 floor.
